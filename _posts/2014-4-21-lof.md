Local outlier factor (LOF) is an outlier detection algorithm, that detects
outliers based on comparing local density of data instance with its neighbors.
It does so to decide if data instance belongs to region of similar density. It
can detect an outlier in a dataset, for which number of clusters is unknown, and
clusters are of different density and size. It's inspired from KNN (K-Nearest
Neighbors) algorithm, and is widely used. There is a [R implemantation
available.](http://www.rdatamining.com/examples/outlier-detection)

The naive approach to do this is to form all pair euclidan distance matrix, and
then run knn query to proceed further. But this approach just sucks, as it is
$\Theta(n^2)$ in terms of both space and time complexity. But, this can be
improvd with [KDTrees.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree), and already its
[implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) exists
in python, thanks to scipy, so lets use this to find outliers.


#### Synthetic dataset

    {% highlight python %}
    %pylab inline
    import numpy as np
    np.random.seed(2) # to reproduce the result

    Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib


    WARNING: pylab import has clobbered these variables: ['dist']
    `%pylab --no-import-all` prevents importing * from pylab and numpy



    dim = 2 # number of dimensions of dataset = 2
    # cluster of normal random variable moderately dense
    data1 = np.random.np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 1500], [[100000, 0], [0, 100000]], 2000)
    
    # very dense
    data2 = np.random.np.random.multivariate_normal([2000, 0], [[10000, 0], [0, 10000]], 2500)
    
    # sparse
    data3 = np.random.np.random.multivariate_normal([2500, 2500], [[100000, 0], [0, 100000]], 500)
    
    # mix the three dataset and shuffle
    data = np.vstack((np.vstack((data1, data2)), data3))
    np.random.shuffle(data)
    
    # add some noise : zipf is skewed distribution and can have extreme values(outliers)
    zipf_alpha = 2.25
    noise = np.random.zipf(zipf_alpha, (5000,dim)) * np.sign((np.random.randint(2, size = (5000, dim)) - 0.5))
    data += noise
    {% endhighlight %}

#### Naive approach to LOF

Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation with DistanceMetric implementation in
scikit-learn. In this, we just compute all-pair euclidean distance, i.e. $d(i,
j) = \|x(i)-x(j)\|_2$.

    {% highlight python %}
    from sklearn.neighbors import DistanceMetric
     # distance between points
    import time
    tic = time.time()
    dist = DistanceMetric.get_metric('euclidean').pairwise(data)
    print '++ took %g msecs for Distance computation' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
    {% endhighlight  %}

    {% highlight python %}
    ++ took 740 msecs for Distance computation
    {% endhighlight  %}

Performing KNN query.In this step, the nearest k neighbors are identified
$N_k(i)$, and radius is the distance of k-th rearest neighbor of a datapoint.
$$ r(i) = \max_{k \in N_k(i)} d(i, k) $$

    {% highlight python %}
    tic = time.time()
    k = 17 # number of neighbors to consider
    # get the radius for each point in dataset (distance to kth nearest neighbor)
    # radius is the distance of kth nearest point for each point in dataset        
    idx_knn = np.argsort(dist, axis=1)[:,1 : k + 1] # by row' get k nearest neighbour   
    radius = np.linalg.norm(data - data[idx_knn[:, -1]], axis = 1) # radius
    print '+++ took %g msecs for KNN Querying' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
    {% endhighlight  %}

    {% highlight python %}
    +++ took 4800 msecs for KNN Querying
    {% endhighlight  %}

Then LRD(Local Reachability distance) is calculated. For this, first reach
distance $rd(i, j)$ is computed between point concern $x(i)$ and its neighbors $
j:j\in N_k(i)$, which is the maximum of euclidean distance or radius $r(i)$ of
point concerned. Then, LRD is the inverse of mean of reach distance of all
k-neighbors of each point.
$$ rd(i, j) = \max{\{d(i, j), r(i) }\} for\ j\in N_k(i) $$
$$LRD(i) = \frac{|N_k(i)|}{ \sum_{j \in N_k(i) }{rd(i, j)}} $$

    {% highlight python %}
    # calculate the local reachability density
    tic = time.time()
    LRD = []
    for i in range(idx_knn.shape[0]):
        LRD.append(np.mean(np.maximum(dist[i, idx_knn[i]], radius[idx_knn[i]])))
    print '++++ took %g msecs for LRD computation' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
    {% endhighlight %}

    {% highlight python %}
    ++++ took 429 msecs for LRD computation
    {% endhighlight %}

finally, the outlier score $LOF$ is calsulated.
$$ LOF(i) = \frac { \sum_{j \in N_k(i)} {\frac{LRD(j)}{LRD(i)} }} { |N_k(i)|} $$

    {% highlight python %}
    # calculating the outlier score
    tic = time.time()
    rho = 1. / np.array(LRD) # inverse of density
    outlier_score = np.sum(rho[idx_knn], axis = 1)/ np.array(rho, dtype = np.float16)
    outlier_score *= 1./k
    print '+++++ took %g msecs for Outlier scoring' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
    {% endhighlight %}

    {% highlight python %}
    +++++ took 9.99999 msecs for Outlier scoring
    {% endhighlight %}

Now lets se the histogram of Outlier score, to choose the optimal threshold to
decid weather a data-point is outlier is not.

    {% highlight python %}
    weights = np.ones_like(outlier_score)/outlier_score.shape[0] # to normalize the histogram to probability plot
    hist(outlier_score, bins = 50, weights = weights, histtype = 'stepfilled', color = 'cyan')
    title('Distribution of outlier score')
    {% endhighlight %}

    {% highlight python %}
    <matplotlib.text.Text at 0x36030588>
    {% endhighlight %}

![png](/images/lof_files/lof_16_1.png)


It can be observd that, the optimal outlier score threshold to decide weather a
data-point is outlier is outlier or not is around 2 for most of the cases, so
lets use it to see our sesults.

    {% highlight python %}
    threshold = 2.
    # plot non outliers as green
    scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c = 'green', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)
    # find the outliers and plot te outliers
    idx = np.where(outlier_score > threshold)
    scatter(data[idx, 0], data[idx, 1], c = 'red', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)
    {% endhighlight  %}

    {% highlight python %}
    <matplotlib.collections.PathCollection at 0x3640e6a0>
    {% endhighlight %}

We have seen the results of LOF with naive approachfor KNN queries. Now lets see
optimisations with KD-Trees.

#### Using KD Trees

KD-Trees insertion and KNN query.

    {% highlight python %}
    from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree as Tree
    tic = time.time()
    BT = Tree(data, leaf_size=5, p=2)
    # Query for k nearest, k + 1 because one of the returnee is self
    dx, idx_knn = BT.query(data[:, :], k = k + 1)
    
    print '++ took %g msecs for Tree KNN Querying' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)

    ++ took 122 msecs for Tree KNN Querying
    {% endhighlight  %}

LRD computation.

    {% highlight python %}
    tic = time.time()
    dx, idx_knn = dx[:, 1:], idx_knn[:, 1:]
    # get the radius for each point in dataset
    # radius is the distance of kth nearest point for each point in dataset        
    radius = dx[:, -1]
    # calculate the local reachability density
    LRD = np.mean(np.maximum(dx, radius[idx_knn]), axis = 1)
    
    print '++ took %g msecs for LRD computation' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)

    ++ took 8.99982 msecs for LRD computation
    {% endhighlight  %}

Now, rest is same, so, i'm just replicating the rsult for completion.

    {% highlight python %}
    # calculating the outlier score
    tic = time.time()
    rho = 1. / np.array(LRD) # inverse of density
    outlier_score = np.sum(rho[idx_knn], axis = 1)/ np.array(rho, dtype = np.float16)
    outlier_score *= 1./k
    print '+++++ took %g msecs for Outlier scoring' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
    
    # plotiing the histogram of outlier score
    weights = np.ones_like(outlier_score)/outlier_score.shape[0] # to normalize the histogram to probability plot
    hist(outlier_score, bins = 50, weights = weights, histtype = 'stepfilled', color = 'cyan')
    title('Distribution of outlier score')
    
    #plotting the result
    threshold = 2.
    # plot non outliers as green
    figure()
    scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c = 'green', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)
    # find the outliers and plot te outliers
    idx = np.where(outlier_score > threshold)
    scatter(data[idx, 0], data[idx, 1], c = 'red', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)

    +++++ took 4.00019 msecs for Outlier scoring

    <matplotlib.collections.PathCollection at 0x36ad0b38>
    {% endhighlight %}

The results are same, and should be.

#### Putting everything together

We see that KDTree outperforms Naive method for narge $n$, but it may not do
well for small number of datasets. In my PC, i cannot run Naive method beyond
