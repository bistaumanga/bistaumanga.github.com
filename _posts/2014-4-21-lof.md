Local outlier factor (LOF) is an outlier detection algorithm, that detects
outliers based on comparing local density of data instance with its neighbors.
It does so to decide if data instance belongs to region of similar density. It
can detect an outlier in a dataset, for which number of clusters is unknown, and
clusters are of different density and size. It's inspired from KNN (K-Nearest
Neighbors) algorithm, and is widely used. There is a [R implemantation
available.](http://www.rdatamining.com/examples/outlier-detection)

The naive approach to do this is to form all pair euclidan distance matrix, and
then run knn query to proceed further. But this approach just sucks, as it is
$\Theta(n^2)$ in terms of both space and time complexity. But, this can be
improvd with [KDTrees.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree), and already its
[implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) exists
in python, thanks to scipy, so lets use this to find outliers.


#### Synthetic dataset

{% highlight python%}
%pylab inline
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(2) # to reproduce the result
{% endhighlight  %}
    
    

Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib


{% highlight python %}
dim = 2 # number of dimensions of dataset = 2
# cluster of normal random variable moderately dense
data1 = np.random.np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 1500], [[100000, 0], [0, 100000]], 2000)

# very dense
data2 = np.random.np.random.multivariate_normal([2000, 0], [[10000, 0], [0, 10000]], 2500)

# sparse
data3 = np.random.np.random.multivariate_normal([2500, 2500], [[100000, 0], [0, 100000]], 500)

# mix the three dataset and shuffle
data = np.vstack((np.vstack((data1, data2)), data3))
np.random.shuffle(data)

# add some noise : zipf is skewed distribution and can have extreme values(outliers)
zipf_alpha = 2.25
noise = np.random.zipf(zipf_alpha, (5000,dim)) * np.sign((np.random.randint(2, size = (5000, dim)) - 0.5))
data += noise
{% endhighlight %}

#### Naive approach to LOF

Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation with DistanceMetric implementation in
scikit-learn. In this, we just compute all-pair euclidean distance, i.e. $d(i,
j) = \|x(i)-x(j)\|_2$.

{% highlight python%}
from sklearn.neighbors import DistanceMetric
 # distance between points
import time
tic = time.time()
dist = DistanceMetric.get_metric('euclidean').pairwise(data)
print '++ took %g msecs for Distance computation' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight python %}
++ took 740 msecs for Distance computation
{% endhighlight  %}

Performing KNN query.In this step, the nearest k neighbors are identified
$N_k(i)$, and radius is the distance of k-th rearest neighbor of a datapoint.
$$ r(i) = \max_{k \in N_k(i)} d(i, k) $$

{% highlight python%}
tic = time.time()
k = 17 # number of neighbors to consider
# get the radius for each point in dataset (distance to kth nearest neighbor)
# radius is the distance of kth nearest point for each point in dataset        
idx_knn = np.argsort(dist, axis=1)[:,1 : k + 1] # by row' get k nearest neighbour   
radius = np.linalg.norm(data - data[idx_knn[:, -1]], axis = 1) # radius
print '+++ took %g msecs for KNN Querying' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python%}
+++ took 4800 msecs for KNN Querying
{% endhighlight%}

Then LRD(Local Reachability distance) is calculated. For this, first reach
distance $rd(i, j)$ is computed between point concern $x(i)$ and its neighbors $
j:j\in N_k(i)$, which is the maximum of euclidean distance or radius $r(i)$ of
point concerned. Then, LRD is the inverse of mean of reach distance of all
k-neighbors of each point.
$$ rd(i, j) = \max{\{d(i, j), r(i) }\} for\ j\in N_k(i) $$
$$LRD(i) = \frac{|N_k(i)|}{ \sum_{j \in N_k(i) }{rd(i, j)}} $$

{% highlight python%}
# calculate the local reachability density
tic = time.time()
LRD = []
for i in range(idx_knn.shape[0]):
    LRD.append(np.mean(np.maximum(dist[i, idx_knn[i]], radius[idx_knn[i]])))
print '++++ took %g msecs for LRD computation' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
{% endhighlight%}

{% highlight python%}
++++ took 429 msecs for LRD computation
{% endhighlight%}

finally, the outlier score $LOF$ is calsulated.
$$ LOF(i) = \frac { \sum_{j \in N_k(i)} {\frac{LRD(j)}{LRD(i)} }} { |N_k(i)|} $$

{% highlight python %}
# calculating the outlier score
tic = time.time()
rho = 1. / np.array(LRD) # inverse of density
outlier_score = np.sum(rho[idx_knn], axis = 1)/ np.array(rho, dtype = np.float16)
outlier_score *= 1./k
print '+++++ took %g msecs for Outlier scoring' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
+++++ took 9.99999 msecs for Outlier scoring
{% endhighlight %}

Now lets se the histogram of Outlier score, to choose the optimal threshold to
decid weather a data-point is outlier is not.

{% highlight python %}
weights = np.ones_like(outlier_score)/outlier_score.shape[0] # to normalize the histogram to probability plot
hist(outlier_score, bins = 50, weights = weights, histtype = 'stepfilled', color = 'cyan')
title('Distribution of outlier score')
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
<matplotlib.text.Text at 0x36030588>
{% endhighlight %}

It can be observd that, the optimal outlier score threshold to decide weather a
data-point is outlier is outlier or not is around 2 for most of the cases, so
lets use it to see our sesults.

{% highlight python %}
threshold = 2.
# plot non outliers as green
scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c = 'green', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)
# find the outliers and plot te outliers
idx = np.where(outlier_score > threshold)
scatter(data[idx, 0], data[idx, 1], c = 'red', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)
{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight python %}
<matplotlib.collections.PathCollection at 0x3640e6a0>
{% endhighlight %}

We have seen the results of LOF with naive approachfor KNN queries. Now lets see
optimisations with KD-Trees.

#### Using KD Trees

KD-Trees insertion and KNN query.

{% highlight python %}
from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree as Tree
tic = time.time()
BT = Tree(data, leaf_size=5, p=2)
# Query for k nearest, k + 1 because one of the returnee is self
dx, idx_knn = BT.query(data[:, :], k = k + 1)

print '++ took %g msecs for Tree KNN Querying' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight python %}        
++ took 122 msecs for Tree KNN Querying
{% endhighlight  %}

LRD computation.

{% highlight python %}
tic = time.time()
dx, idx_knn = dx[:, 1:], idx_knn[:, 1:]
# get the radius for each point in dataset
# radius is the distance of kth nearest point for each point in dataset        
radius = dx[:, -1]
# calculate the local reachability density
LRD = np.mean(np.maximum(dx, radius[idx_knn]), axis = 1)

print '++ took %g msecs for LRD computation' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)
{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight python %}
++ took 8.99982 msecs for LRD computation
{% endhighlight  %}

Now, rest is same, so, i'm just replicating the rsult for completion.

{% highlight python %}
# calculating the outlier score
tic = time.time()
rho = 1. / np.array(LRD) # inverse of density
outlier_score = np.sum(rho[idx_knn], axis = 1)/ np.array(rho, dtype = np.float16)
outlier_score *= 1./k
print '+++++ took %g msecs for Outlier scoring' %  ((time.time() - tic)* 1000)

# plotiing the histogram of outlier score
weights = np.ones_like(outlier_score)/outlier_score.shape[0] # to normalize the histogram to probability plot
hist(outlier_score, bins = 50, weights = weights, histtype = 'stepfilled', color = 'cyan')
title('Distribution of outlier score')

#plotting the result
threshold = 2.
# plot non outliers as green
figure()
scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], c = 'green', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)
# find the outliers and plot te outliers
idx = np.where(outlier_score > threshold)
scatter(data[idx, 0], data[idx, 1], c = 'red', s = 10, edgecolors='None', alpha=0.5)

{% endhighlight  %}

{% highlight python %}

+++++ took 4.00019 msecs for Outlier scoring

The results are same, and should be.

#### Putting everything together

Lets create a class, to combine evrything together. It will be important in
evaluating performance. From above results, we note that the most time is spent
for KNN querying. Also, i will create a method to compare the performances and see the results.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/bistaumanga/9207578.js" height="50"></script>


Now, lets compare the performace of 2 methods- Naive and KDTree implementations.

{% highlight python %}
perf_test(methods = ['Tree', 'Naive'], n_list = [2 ** i for i in range(4, 14)], plot = True)
{% endhighlight %}

![center](/images/lof_files/lof_35_1.png)


We see that KDTree outperforms Naive method for narge $n$, but it may not do
well for small number of datasets. In my PC, i cannot run Naive method beyond
$2^{13}$ datapoints, or else i receie MemoryError. So, lets evauate te
performance of KDTrees upto 1Million datapoints.

{% highlight python %}
perf_test(methods = ['Tree'], n_list = [2 ** i for i in range(4, 21)], plot = True)
{% endhighlight %}


![center](/images/lof_files/lof_37_1.png)


We can see, algorithm is scaling well with data-set size $n$. If we analyse the
complexity of algorithm, its linearithmic , i.e. $\Theta (n\log{n})$.
