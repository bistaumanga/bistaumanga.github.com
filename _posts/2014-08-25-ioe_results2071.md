IoE has published its [first entrance results few days ago](http://ioe.edu.np/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BE-Entrance-2071-Result-Roll-Wise-with-Rank.pdf), and then later [republished the entrance results](http://ioe.edu.np/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BE-Entrance-Result-2071-Revised-List-Roll-Wise-with-Rank.pdf) citing some technical mistakes. The mistakes that ioe has said was due to mistake in ranking algorithms in case of same entrance scores, that is giving priority to particulat subject to break the ties. But when i went through the scores and did some simple join operations, i found the entrance score of 16 students has changed.

##Disclaimer

I have used [online tool to convert pdf to csv](http://online2pdf.com/powerpoint2pdf). So, i don't claim the accuracy of the analysis as inaccuries may be incurred.

##Results of Analysis

I converted the pdf to csv. The csv for [original result is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/41yeffq19rz7xt5/ioe-first.csv?dl=0) and for [revised result is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/87iemiusy0ngubm/ioe%20second.csv?dl=0).

The code for analysis is

and the results are here

As mentioned by ioe, if the technical problem was only due to problem with ranking algorithms in case of ties, these differences should not have occured, but the ranks of 16 students have changed. Why?? IoE must answer this.....
