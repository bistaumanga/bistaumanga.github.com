IoE has published its [first entrance results few days ago](http://ioe.edu.np/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BE-Entrance-2071-Result-Roll-Wise-with-Rank.pdf), and then later [republished the entrance results](http://ioe.edu.np/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BE-Entrance-Result-2071-Revised-List-Roll-Wise-with-Rank.pdf) citing some technical mistakes. The results contrasts for following few cases.

##Results of Analysis

###changed scores

I converted the pdf to csv. The csv for [original result is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/41yeffq19rz7xt5/ioe-first.csv?dl=0) and for [revised result is here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/87iemiusy0ngubm/ioe%20second.csv?dl=0).

The code for analysis is [here](https://gist.github.com/bistaumanga/2518f022a9801442f8ff)
and the results are here

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

</ul>

</div>


###Contrasting list

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
 <div class="panel-heading"> 2 students missed the first list, and 2 missed the second list. </div>
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item">Roll number <em>7116</em> and <em>7123</em> appear in revised result only.</li>
<li class="list-group-item">Roll number <em>7125</em> and <em>7117</em> appear in first result only.</li>
</ul>

</div>


####Disclaimer

I have used [online tool to convert pdf to csv](http://online2pdf.com/powerpoint2pdf). So, i don't claim the accuracy of the analysis as inaccuries may be incurred.
