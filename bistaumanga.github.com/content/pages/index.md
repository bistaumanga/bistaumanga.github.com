# Umanga Bista (उमङ्ग बिष्ट)

I'm **Umanga Bista**, based in Melbourne, Australia, originally from [Lamjung, Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamjung_District).

I am interested in applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and also in analyzing web and social media data.

## Senior Applied Scientist of Artificial Intelligence at Oracle [May 2021 - now]

I joined Oracle in Melbourne, Australia as Applied AI Scientist. Currently i work in applying AI to solve problems in clinical/medical domains using Gen AI, RAG, etc. I previously worked in Natural Language Processing for building Conversational AI, and building Oracle Agents platform.

## Australian National University [Mar 2017-Apr 2021]

I did PhD at the **[Computational Media Lab](http://cm.cecs.anu.edu.au)**, **[Australian National University](http://anu.edu.au)**. My thesis title is **"Comparative Summarization of Document Collections"**.

My PhD supervisors were [Prof. Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/), [Dr. Aditya Menon](https://akmenon.github.io/), [Dr. Alexander Mathews](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u4534172/) and [Dr. Lizhen Qu](https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/qu-l).

I was also a **Casual Research Engineer** in Computational Media Lab, developing and maintaining 24x7 scalable data collection and preprocessing pipelines.

**Tutoring:** Programming for Data Scientists [2020], Intro to Machine Learning [2020], Document Analysis [2017, 2018]
